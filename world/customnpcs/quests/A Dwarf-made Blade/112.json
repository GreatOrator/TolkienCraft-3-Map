You found the brigand Giles, who stole Thonrum's blade. Unfortunately for him, the blade broke and he was slain by unknown assailants. You should speak to Lucious Warrer and let him know that Giles will no longer trouble his family.

Thonrum Ironsword has agreed to forge a new blade for Lucious Warrer, but in exchange, Thonrum has given you three items to take to Lucious for him to repair. The dwarf said that if he likes Luciousâ€™ work, he will call it even on the cost of the two swords he is having to make.",
