I would ask that you continue in your pursuit of the Nazgûl and travel into the Misty Mountains. There you may seek the aid of Glóin, who has established a camp at the end of the pass out of Rivendell that leads to the Misty Mountains.

Go now, for not only the safety of Rivendell is at stake. All of Middle-earth depends on your actions.",
