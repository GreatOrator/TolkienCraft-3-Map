Folks say that at night you can sometimes see him, clothed in black, face hidden behind a dark mask with an even darker cape all flapping and flowing behind him, riding along the roads of the Shire. He's turned vigilante, protecting us all from bandits and goblins and anything else nasty trying to creep into our towns!",
