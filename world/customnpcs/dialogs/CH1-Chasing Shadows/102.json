A tribe of troll once lived near Dol Guldur, and we who fought them called these creatures Wood-trolls. Once these were wandering, individual creatures, loath to unite or even live near to their fellows. At Dol Guldur, however, something caused them to join together. A king was raised among them, and he unified the Wood-trolls into a terrible force. My father sent many warriors to defeat the Wood-trolls and it was done.",
