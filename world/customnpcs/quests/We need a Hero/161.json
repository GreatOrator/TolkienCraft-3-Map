I have heard many tales of your adventures and it had made me decide to let you in on some research I have been doing these many years.

",
                "My peers have thought me a bit mad, reading ancient texts from ages long past for clues to a secret treasure of great power.  They mocked me and laughed at my research.

",
                "Well no more!  I have finally stumbled on to the whereabouts of this artifact.  The problem is the location.

",
                "This is where you come in.  Should you be willing, I need you to come speak to me at Brandy Hall in Bucklebury.  I can fill you in on all of the details once you arrive.

Wishing you the best,

Merovech Hornwood"
