I do not know whether it was through some machination of the False King, or whether it was purely an evil chance, but our march was brought to an abrupt end. As we marched east, we found ourselves confronted by a vale filled with terrible statues. The Watcher, the people of Stoneyford called it. That some spirit of evil vigilance abode in the stones there was no doubt, for we could all feel the oppression of them. It was here that Cromhes bade me remain.",
