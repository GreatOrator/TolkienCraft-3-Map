Bilbo’s house is Bag-end in the northern part of Hobbiton. Derwyn Rease is in the town of Archet, north-east of Bree-town.

You will need a mithril nugget, which might still be in Bilbo’s house in the Shire, and a key to cast a mould from, which might be obtained from Derwyn Rease, the new Captain of Archet.",
