Dragons are terrible clever you know, and so mine would tell me stories and teach me things that only dragons know!

But, you know, I keep thinking about that poor mountain. Why, it's even called the Lonely Mountain, and that was when it still had a dragon friend of its own. But since Bilbo scared off the dragon I bet that mountain is even lonelier. I feel so bad for it some nights I just cry into my plush sheep, Petunia.",
