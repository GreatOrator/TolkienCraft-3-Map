Most of the smiths of Dale dwell work in the market.

Thonrum has told you that he thinks his latest blade was stolen by one of the Man-smiths. He thinks that a warrior, such as yourself, might intimidate the thief into confessing and returning the stolen blade.

Lucious Warrer seemed a bit nervous, you should go back and talk to him again.",
