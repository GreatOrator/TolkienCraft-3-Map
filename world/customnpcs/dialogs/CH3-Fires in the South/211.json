Cromhes quickly earned respect, for he was a great captain among us and was able to inspire heart. We learned that these people were under the oppression of a remnant of Dol Guldur that had returned to Khazad-dûm from within Mirkwood...but worse, a sorcerer much likened to the Witch-king of old had also come to the evil city.",
