The two entered the nearly impregnable inner keep of the fortress. Glóin believes the only way to enter the inner keep is to learn its secret entrance.

Glóin told you that to learn how to access the secret entrance to Gundabad's inner keep, you will need to take the plans for the fortress placed in its cornerstone.",
