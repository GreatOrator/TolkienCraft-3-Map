Thonrum Ironsword has agreed to forge a new blade for Lucious Warrer, but in exchange, Thonrum has given you three items to take to Lucious for him to repair. The dwarf said that if he likes Luciousâ€™ work, he will call it even on the cost of the two swords he is having to make.

Thonrum urged you to go to Pierce's brigand camp and try to convince the brigand-captain not to harm Lucious' daughter.",
