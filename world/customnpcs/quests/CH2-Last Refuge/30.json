The dwarf-vault that contains the key-stone is south of Rivendell, near the source of the Bruinen. Gl贸in is at his camp north of Rivendell at the east-end of the pass that leads through the Misty Mountains.

Gl贸in has asked you to retrieve a key-stone from an old dwarf-vault. The key-stone will allow you entry into the Dourhand-occupied dwarf-keep.",
