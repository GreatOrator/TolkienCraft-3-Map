Thonrum Ironsword has agreed to forge a new blade for Lucious Warrer, but in exchange, Thonrum has given you three items to take to Lucious for him to repair. The dwarf said that if he likes Lucious’ work, he will call it even on the cost of the two swords he is having to make.

Lucious Warrer told you that Pierce, the brigand-captain, will kill his daughter, unless he gets a new sword. Lucious has asked you to retrieve the sword from Thonrum.",
