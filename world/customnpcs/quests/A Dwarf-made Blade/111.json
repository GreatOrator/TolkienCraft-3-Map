You found the brigand Giles, who stole Thonrum's blade. Unfortunately for him, the blade broke and he was slain by unknown assailants. You should speak to Lucious Warrer and let him know that Giles will no longer trouble his family.

Return to Thonrum Ironsword to see if he can reforge the sword.",
