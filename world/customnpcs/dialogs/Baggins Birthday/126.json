Now, from what I hear tell, no one's quite sure what really happened after that, but my brother's son's friend's cousin works down at The Green Dragon, and he swears he shipped off a barrel that was heavier than the others the next day, and that it rolled funny like something was in it. Didn't think to question it until after the fact!",
